Rainbox
=======

Provides pretty printing of boxes in two dimensions.  Rainbox is
useful for console programs that need to format tabular data.

Documentation
=============

In addition to the Haddock documentation, a tutorial is available in
[the Rainbox.Tutorial module](lib/Rainbox/Tutorial.lhs).  This
module is best read in your text editor or through the Github web
interface, as it is written in literate Haskell, which HsColour does
not fare so well with.
